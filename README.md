# Azure Spring SDK for GraalVM Native Image Support

This repository contains some samples of building [Azure Spring SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/main/sdk/spring) projects into [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/), as well as some configurations needed. Please notice that this is only the early support for this feature.

This project rely on [Azure SDK for Java GraalVM](https://github.com/JonathanGiles/azure-sdk-graalvm), which needs be installed into your local maven repository.

You can also check [Spring Native Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#overview) for more information.
